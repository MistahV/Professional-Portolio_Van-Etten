Welcome to my own personal portfolio!

I designed this website to showcase my learning since starting the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and to serve as a potential starting point with employers. There are three short sections: About, Prior Work, and Contact that you can navigate to using the links at the top. 

The About section provides background information on myself, while the Prior Work section contains descriptions and links to projects that I've done while in the Bootcamp. Obviously, the Contact section provides quick infromation on how to contact me further.

Project cards will be updated as they are completed!
